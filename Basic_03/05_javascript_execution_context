<!-- JavaScript Execution Context(JEC)
 {} ==> Global Execution Context(this) ==> variable
 JavaScript ==>  JS is a single threaded language

 Types of Execution Context
 1. Global Execution Context
 2. Function Execution Context
 3. Eval Execution Context

 {} ==> Memory Creation Phase(Creation Phase)
    ==> Execution Phase

    Example ==> -->
<!-- 
    let val1 = 10;
    let val2 = 5; 
    function addNum(num1, num2){
        let total = num1 + num2;
        return total
    }
    let result1 = addNum(val1, val2)
    let result2 = addNum(10, 2)

    1. Global Execution
       this

     2. Memory Phase
     
     val1 ==> undefined
     var2 ==> undefined
     addNum ==> definition
     result1 ==> undefined
     result2 ==> undefined

     3. Execution Phase

     val1 ==> 10
     val2 ==> 5
     addNum =======>   new variable 
                       environment
     result1 = 15
     result2 = 12         +
                       Execution thread         -->

                     <!-- Note:- work is finished then delete the Execution thread -->

<!-- Memory Phase   

val1 ==> undefined            
val2 ==> undefined
total ==> undefined

Execution Phase
num1 ==> 10
num2 ==> 5
total ==> 15 -->
